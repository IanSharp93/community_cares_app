    <p>One in four young adults aged 18-24 has a diagonsable mental illness and though over 70% of students living with a mental 
    conition experience a mental health crisis on campus, at least 34% report that their college did not know about their crisis.  
    Suicide is the third leading cause of death on college campuses.  More than 80% of college students felt overwhelmed by all 
    they had to do in the past year and 45% have felt things were hopeless.  These crises are not self-contained, and students 
    need meaningful short and long-term support networks to rely on and feel comfortable approaching.
